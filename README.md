Candid9 is a fun service for taking portaits of strangers in public and sharing back to the subject!

Here is a sequence of events for how the app works:

1. Photographer creates Candid9 account and creates batch of 25 Photo Sessions.
2. Photographer prints out 25 Candid9 tickets, each has a unqiue QR Code that points to a Photo Session.
3. Photograher hits the street and approaches people saying "Hey you guys look great, can I take your portait and I'll share it with you also?"
4. Photographer takes photos of subjects.
5. Photographer then takes a photo of a ticket before handing to the subject, which matches QR Code (Photo Session) to the subject.
6. Subject can scan QR Code right away and enter phone number to be notified when photos are published.
7. Photographer repeats this until bored/tired/hungry.
8. Photographer later edits and uploads photos to the Photo Sessions, using the QR Codes in the photos to know which photos go where.
9. Photographer prices and publishes each Photo Session
10. Subject is notified when photos are published. Watermarked photos can be viewed, watermark-free available for purchase!


I have already sold 3 photos as a photographer, so it works! Most people's reaction to the ticket is like "oh, of course that's how it works, thank you!"
