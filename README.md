Candid9 is a fun service for taking portraits of strangers in public and sharing back to the subject!

It's intended to be used in a busy touristy area.

  <summary>How it works as the subject</summary>
  <p>1. Photographer approaches and says "Hello! I'm a photographer that takes portraits of strangers. This would make a great photo, can I take this photo and I will share it with you also?"</p>
  <p>2. Subject says "Yes!"</p>
  <p>3. Photographer takes photos.</p>
  <p>4. Photographer hands ticket with QR Code and says "The photos will be uploaded to this QR Code later. You can scan the QR Code now and input your phone number to be notified when I do the upload!"</p>
  <p>5. Subject says "Oh great that's cool, thank you!"</p>

  <summary>How it works as the Photographer</summary>
  <p>Here is a sequence of events for how the app works:</p>
  <p>1. Photographer creates Candid9 account and creates batch of 25 Photo Sessions.</p>
  <p>2. Photographer prints out 25 Candid9 tickets, each has a unique QR Code that points to a Photo Session.</p>
  <p>3. Photographer hits the street and approaches people saying "Hey you guys look great, can I take your portrait and I'll share it with you also?"</p>
  <p>4. Photographer takes photos of subjects.</p>
  <p>5. Photographer then takes a photo of a ticket before handing to the subject, which matches QR Code (Photo Session) to the subject.</p>
  <p>6. Subject can scan QR Code right away and enter phone number to be notified when photos are published.</p>
  <p>7. Photographer repeats this until bored/tired/hungry.</p>
  <p>8. Photographer later edits and uploads photos to the Photo Sessions, using the QR Codes in the photos to know which photos go where.</p>
  <p>9. Photographer prices and publishes each Photo Session</p>
  <p>10. Subject is notified when photos are published. Watermarked photos can be viewed, watermark-free available for purchase!</p>
  <p>I have already sold 3 photos as a photographer, so it works! Most people's reaction to the ticket is like "oh, of course that's how it works, thank you!"</p>
